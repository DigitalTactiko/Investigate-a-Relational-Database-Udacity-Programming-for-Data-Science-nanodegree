# Investigate-a-Relational-Database-Udacity-Programming-for-Data-Science-nanodegree
This is the final project of the “Introduction to SQL” module.  The Sakila Database is a fictitious DVD rentals database consisting in 15 tables. Our job was to get business insights by accessing the data with SQL and elaborate a small presentation after.  There are three archives in the repository:  Dvd-rental-erd-2. PNG file containing Sakila’s Entity Relationship Diagram. A map to understand the database.  TXT file containing 5 SQL queries. Those are the queries we used to retrieve information for the following presentation SQL Project Submission Template. PDF containing 4 Powerpoint slides. There we presented the insights that we could get after retrieving the preview data. I strongly suggest opening first the PDF to familiarize yourself with the results and then open the txt file to see the queries.
